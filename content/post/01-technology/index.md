In the 21st century, we are passing the technological era. Technology is the most powerful weapon humans have. Technology is an applied method of knowledge that is used for achieving the goals of humans. Today, technology is used for different sectors like agriculture, transportation, health, etc. In the ancient eras, humans used manual methods to do their day-to-day activities. But, as of today humans mostly use technology to make their life easier. Wait a moment and think about your daily routine. You inevitably use smart devices in your day-to-day life. As of present, those have become an integral part of our life. A few decades ago we used cell phones. Primarily, they are used for calling and sending messages. But as of now, the cell phone has transformed into a gateway for the modern world. It can be used for taking high-resolution pictures, watching high-quality videos, browsing the internet, and playing interactive games. The amazing thing is how to handle all the above tasks in a small device.
